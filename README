This project uses https://aec.gov.au AEC electorate shape files and elector counts, 
https://www.abs.gov.au ABS electorate details, and voting patterns on climate change 
for the corresponding parliamentarians sourced from https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/.
See References.txt file.

The AEC and ABS data is Â© Commonwealth of Australia.

While one can't assert categorically what an individual politician may personally 
think regarding climate change, what they have stated on public record and their 
personal voting patterns give a good guide. The climate change rating is my subjective 
assessment of their climate change position based on public statements and how they
have historically voted.  The rational for the assessments are recorded in the
Representatives.xlsx and Senate.xlsx files.
